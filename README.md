# Instructions

- Read this the code in main.py
- Spot the problems 🐞. 
- Modify the code to fix the program. 
- No shortcuts  - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution. 

The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game. 

> `Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.` 

>   `When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".` 

>     `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 

>       `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`

# Hint

There is more than one fix required.
